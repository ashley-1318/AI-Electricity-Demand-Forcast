AI-Based Electricity Demand and Peak Load Forecasting for Tamil Nadu Power System
View Demo Site

Project Summary
This project develops an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based forecasting model to predict electricity demand and peak load for Tamil Nadu’s power system. The model integrates historical load, weather data, calendar effects, and regional growth indicators to capture unique demand patterns including strong evening peaks and renewable energy variability. Advanced machine learning techniques such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), SVM (Support Vector Machines), and Fuzzy Neural Networks are used to generate accurate short-term and long-term hourly projections, helping optimize power procurement, grid stability, and renewable integration.

Features
Hourly electricity demand and peak load forecasting

Incorporation of weather variables: temperature, humidity, wind speed, rainfall

Calendar effects: public holidays, weekends, seasonal variations

Regional socioeconomic indicators including real estate development trends

Multi-model AI approach for robustness and accuracy

Interactive visualization dashboard hosted at Demo Site

Motivation
Tamil Nadu is experiencing rapid demand growth, significant renewable energy penetration, and complex load patterns influenced by climate and socio-economic factors. Accurate demand forecasting is crucial to ensure reliable power supply, reduce costly power imbalances, and enable efficient integration of clean energy sources.

Data Sources
Historical electricity load data from Tamil Nadu generation and distribution utilities

Weather data from publicly available meteorological sources

Regional development and holiday calendars

Methodology
Data preprocessing and feature engineering to incorporate multi-source inputs

Training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models: LSTM, SVM, FNN

Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization for accuracy

Ensemble modeling to leverage strengths of individual models

Deployment of the best-performing model for live forecasting on the web platform

Usage
Clone the repository

Install required dependencies (listed in requirements.txt)

Prepare datasets in the specified format using available preprocessing scripts

Train models with training scripts provided

Run inference to generate demand forecasts

Use the web application for interactive exploration and visualization
